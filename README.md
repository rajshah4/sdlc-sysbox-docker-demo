# SDLC Automation Demo for GitHub

**Sparse GitHub bug -> OpenHands automation -> spec, code, tests, review, and evidence back in GitHub.**

This repo is a customer-facing GitHub-native SDLC Automation Demo. It shows how
OpenHands can turn lightweight GitHub signals into controlled engineering work
while humans keep authority through issues, PRs, labels, comments, reviews, and
merge decisions.

The target app is intentionally small: a Petstore catalog and adoption service.
That keeps the demo easy to follow while still producing real artifacts: code
diffs, tests, UI checks, review comments, and PRs.

This repo is GitHub-first: labels are the automation boundary, GitHub remains
the system of record, and OpenHands does the agent work only when a human asks
for it.

## What Problem This Solves

Teams want agentic SDLC automation, but they do not want a parallel workflow
where requests disappear into a black box. The common bottleneck is:

1. A bug or product request starts as a sparse issue or comment.
2. Engineers need to understand the issue, find the right code, implement a fix, add tests, and preserve review judgment.
3. Demo operators need a path that is easy to explain, repeat, and inspect.

This demo keeps that loop inside GitHub. A human applies a label, OpenHands runs
one bounded automation, then posts evidence back where the team already works.

## The Work Cells

| Work cell | Trigger | What OpenHands does | What humans control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Context Scout** | Apply `openhands-context` to a sparse issue | Builds a cost-aware context reuse report from AGENTS.md, repo-local skills, prior reports, targeted repo search, and previous OpenHands run memory | Whether to proceed to build, review, or QA work |
| **Bug to PR** | Apply `openhands-build` to a sparse bug issue | Clarifies the bug, checks repo-local docs and evidence, writes OpenSpec-style change artifacts, implements the fix, runs tests, and opens a PR | Scope, review, approval, and merge |
| **Code Review** | Apply `openhands-review` to a PR | Reads the diff, checks risk areas, and posts review findings as a PR comment | Which findings block the PR |
| **Automated QA** | Apply `openhands-qa` to a PR | Builds or updates test coverage, runs deterministic checks, and includes UI test evidence where applicable | Test acceptance and merge readiness |

## What You'll See

- A low-cost context scout shows which repo memory, skills, prior evidence, search results, and previous OpenHands runs can be reused before expensive model work.
- An optional sidekick mode makes the context-saving pattern visible as separate read-only scout conversations before the implementation agent runs.
- A sparse bug issue becomes a PR with an implementation branch and visible OpenSpec-style proposal/spec/design/task artifacts.
- A PR receives an automated review comment rather than a silent background score.
- QA output lands on the PR with concrete test files and command results. The repo also includes a prebuilt Playwright browser-evidence example with screenshot, GIF, video, and report generation.
- Status labels such as `openhands:in-progress`, `openhands:needs-human`, and
  `openhands:done` make the automation state visible without leaving GitHub.

## How It's Built

This repo is intentionally composed from OpenHands platform features and
repo-local knowledge, not a custom agent runtime.

| Capability | Where it lives | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenHands Automations | `automations/github/`, `automations/jira/` | Prompt presets registered in the Rajistics OpenHands instance. GitHub uses label-triggered work cells; Jira uses the `jira-direct` webhook for sparse task-to-PR demos. |
| Repo-local skills | `skills/` | Reusable skills encode context reuse, story/spec, optional context-sidekick scouting, QA, and code-review behavior with scripts and references that customers can inspect. The story skill follows Fission-AI/OpenSpec lineage while avoiding live package installs during timed automation runs. |
| Repo memory | `docs/repo-memory/` | Durable product rules, model-routing guidance, and previous run lessons keep future agents from rediscovering the same context. |
| Sidekick mode | `automations/jira/jira-to-story-sidekick-v2/`, `skills/sdlc-sidekick-launcher/`, `skills/sdlc-context-sidekick/` | Optional multi-conversation path where lightweight scouts gather docs, logs, and repo context before the implementation agent runs. |
| OpenSpec-style artifacts | `openspec/` | Repo-local context and generated change folders keep request, proposal, spec delta, design, and tasks version controlled. |
| Deterministic scripts | `scripts/` | Preflight, label setup, fixture simulation, and Petstore checks run before broader model reasoning where possible. |
| GitHub templates and labels | `.github/` | Issues, PRs, and labels define the human approval boundaries. |
| Petstore app | `app/` | A small API/UI surface gives the automations realistic code and tests to work on. |
| Playwright UI evidence | `app/web/tests/` | Browser QA example that records video, creates a GIF preview, captures a screenshot, and writes a report for PR evidence when Playwright is available. |

Cost and security are part of the demo design: event-driven labels avoid
unnecessary LLM calls, preflight scripts catch configuration issues without
using a model, different LLM profiles can be used for scouting/coding/review/QA, and
secrets stay in the OpenHands secret store or local `.env`, never in the repo.

## Fast Local Validation

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
python3 scripts/preflight_github_demo.py --offline
python3 scripts/simulate_github_event.py --fixture tests/fixtures/github_issue_labeled_context.json
python3 scripts/simulate_github_event.py --fixture tests/fixtures/github_issue_labeled_build.json
```

## Repo Map

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | Small Petstore app, static UI, and app tests. |
| `automations/` | OpenHands prompt-preset automation packages for GitHub and Jira. |
| `docs/repo-memory/` | Durable memory for product rules, model routing, and previous OpenHands run lessons. |
| `openspec/` | OpenSpec-style project context and generated change folders for story-to-PR work. |
| `skills/` | Repo-local OpenHands skills with scripts and references. |
| `scripts/` | Deterministic setup, registration, preflight, and QA helpers. |
| `docs/` | Customer-facing setup, walkthrough, and validation notes. |
| `.github/` | Issue/PR templates and label definitions; the live demo uses OpenHands labels, not GitHub Actions. |

## Register OpenHands Automations

OpenHands Automations should be registered with the prompt preset API. The
GitHub package specs live under `automations/github/`; the normal Jira package
spec lives under `automations/jira/jira-to-story/`; the visible sidekick demo
package lives under `automations/jira/jira-to-story-sidekick-v2/`.

Dry-run the registration payloads:

```bash
python3 scripts/register_github_automations.py --dry-run
python3 scripts/register_jira_automations.py --dry-run
```

Apply registration when `OPENHANDS_HOST_GITHUB`, an OpenHands API key such as `OPENHANDS_API_KEY_GITHUB` or `OPENHANDS_API_KEY_ORG`, `GITHUB_DEMO_REPOSITORY`, and `GITHUB_DEMO_REPO_URL` are set:

```bash
python3 scripts/register_github_automations.py --apply
```

Register Jira packages with:

```bash
python3 scripts/register_jira_automations.py --apply
```

For a fast live demo, keep `jira-to-story` enabled and `jira-to-story-sidekick-v2`
disabled. For the visible multi-conversation demo, switch those states and create
the Jira Task with label `sidekick-v2`.

No secrets belong in this repo. Store OpenHands, GitHub, Jira, and Slack credentials in the OpenHands secret store or a local `.env` excluded by `.gitignore`.
