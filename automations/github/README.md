# GitHub OpenHands Automations

This folder contains the GitHub-native automation package set for the SDLC Automation Demo.

The packages use the OpenHands Automations prompt preset API instead of custom SDK tarballs. That keeps registration simple, avoids ad hoc dependency installation, and makes the prompt visible in the OpenHands UI.
