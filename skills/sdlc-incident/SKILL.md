# SDLC SRE Incident Triage

Use this skill when a GitHub issue reports a production symptom.

This skill is based on the SRE Cloud Run remediation demo pattern: observe first, separate evidence from hypotheses, use deterministic scripts before broad reasoning, and keep production changes behind explicit safety checks and human control.

## GitHub Boundaries

- Trigger label: `openhands-incident`
- Status labels: `openhands:ready`, `openhands:in-progress`, `openhands:needs-human`, `openhands:done`
- Incident automation may post an operator report or open a small PR.
- Use runtime secret `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub API calls, `gh`, PRs, labels, and comments. Do not use `GITHUB` or `GH_TOKEN`; if auth is missing or returns 401, stop and report `GITHUB_TOKEN` is missing or invalid without printing it.
- Incident automation must not merge, deploy, change IAM, rotate secrets, or mutate cloud resources without the bounded safe-remediation criteria.

## Sparse Issue Contract

Incident issues should read like real operator reports, not automation prompts.
Assume the issue may contain only a symptom such as "`/api/status` is returning
HTTP 500" plus impact notes. The skill provides the operating procedure:

- Use the repo-local SRE flow and available Cloud Run / Cloud Logging evidence.
- Collect read-only evidence before making any recommendation.
- If GCP credentials, logs, or the live Cloud Run target are unavailable, do not
  mutate cloud resources.
- Post what evidence is missing, recommended next steps, and label the issue
  `openhands:needs-human` when the automation cannot safely proceed.
- Keep all secrets in the OpenHands secret store or local environment; never
  copy secret values into issue comments, logs, screenshots, PRs, or specs.
- When reporting missing configuration, describe missing capabilities rather
  than sensitive secret inventory. For example, say "Cloud Logging could not be
  queried" instead of printing token lengths, service-account metadata, or a
  detailed yes/no list of sensitive secret variables.

## Flow

0. Use `skills/sdlc-context-reuse/SKILL.md` or `scripts/build_context_reuse_report.py` to reuse durable repo rules, prior incident notes, and targeted logs before broad exploration.
1. State symptom and impact.
2. Gather recent issue/PR context, Cloud Run target, and Cloud Logging evidence.
3. Use `scripts/petstore_gcp_observe.py` for read-only observation when GCP credentials are available.
4. Summarize observation JSON with `skills/sdlc-incident/scripts/triage_observation.py`.
5. Separate facts, hypotheses, and unknowns.
6. Determine incident class, confidence, and safe remediation status.
7. Post an operator report, or create a small fix PR only when the fix is bounded and testable.

Read `references/cloud-run-petstore-incident.md` when the symptom involves GCP, Cloud Run, Cloud Logging, pending pets, degraded status, or runtime remediation.

## Known Incident Class

`petstore_website_catalog_regression`:

- Symptom: pending pets appear in the available-pets experience.
- Cloud Run status: `/api/status` returns degraded/500 in incident mode.
- Log evidence: `jsonPayload.incident.type="petstore_website_catalog_regression"` and `error_code="PENDING_PET_VISIBLE"`.
- Safe action: restore runtime catalog filter to available pets only.
- Approved script: `python3 scripts/petstore_config_fix.py` only after observation reports `diagnosis.safe_to_remediate=true`.

## Safe Remediation Criteria

Open a fix PR only if:

- the incident maps to one local code path
- reproduction is available
- the fix is small
- regression tests can be added
- no schema, auth, IAM, secret, billing, or data migration decision is required

Run runtime remediation only if:

- a human explicitly asked for the bounded remediation, or the demo script says this run is allowed
- `scripts/petstore_gcp_observe.py` reports `diagnosis.safe_to_remediate=true`
- the action is limited to `scripts/petstore_config_fix.py`
- `DEMO_ADMIN_TOKEN` exists in the OpenHands secret store or local environment
- the report includes before/after evidence

If any condition is missing, stay report-only and label `openhands:needs-human`.

## Report Shape

```

## Evidence Requirements

- Cloud Run service, region, and project names without credentials.
- Logs Explorer link when available.
- Confirmation checks from `diagnosis.confirmation_checks`.
- Sample structured log fields without secrets.
- Clear distinction between "observed", "inferred", and "not tested".
- No secret values, token lengths, service-account JSON metadata, or detailed
  sensitive secret inventory.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask for human input if the incident points to IAM, secrets, billing, deployment config, data correction, destructive actions, unknown incident classes, or cloud evidence that contradicts the issue symptom.
