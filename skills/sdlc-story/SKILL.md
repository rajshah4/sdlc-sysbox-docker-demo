# SDLC Request To PR

Use this skill when OpenHands turns a GitHub issue into a small reviewable PR.

The customer-facing story is: a sparse GitHub request becomes an OpenSpec-style change proposal, spec delta, design, and task list, then an implementation branch, then a PR that humans review and merge.

## OpenSpec Lineage

This skill intentionally follows the Fission-AI/OpenSpec project:

- Project: `https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec`
- Site: `https://openspec.pro`
- Upstream pattern: `openspec/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, and `specs/.../spec.md`

For live OpenHands Automations, do not run `npm install`, `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec`, or `openspec init/update` inside the timed label-triggered run. Those steps add network and toolchain variance to a customer demo. Instead, create the OpenSpec-style artifacts directly from `references/open-spec-template.md` and validate them with `scripts/validate_open_spec.py`.

If the OpenSpec CLI is preinstalled and the operator explicitly asks to use it, it is acceptable to run read-only or already-installed CLI validation. Otherwise, keep the live automation deterministic and explain in the PR that the artifacts follow OpenSpec lineage without invoking the CLI during the run.

## Inputs

- GitHub issue title, body, labels, and comments
- repository default branch
- target source branch
- acceptance criteria when present
- linked PRs or previous automation comments when present

Sparse issues are acceptable when the title maps to an existing Petstore behavior. Infer the smallest safe implementation, but write the assumptions, spec delta, task list, and human gates into the OpenSpec-style change folder before editing code.

## GitHub Boundaries

- Trigger label: `openhands-build`
- Status labels: `openhands:ready`, `openhands:in-progress`, `openhands:needs-human`, `openhands:done`
- Use event context; do not poll GitHub.
- Avoid result comments that repeat the exact trigger text.
- Never merge, bypass review, change branch protection, or alter deployment settings.

## Workflow

1. Read `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the issue context.
2. Run `python3 skills/sdlc-story/scripts/extract_acceptance_criteria.py "<issue title>"` with the issue body on stdin when useful.
3. Create or update an OpenSpec-style change folder at `openspec/changes/github-issue-<number>-<slug>/`.
4. Include `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, and at least one `specs/<capability>/spec.md` file.
5. Validate the change folder with `python3 skills/sdlc-story/scripts/validate_open_spec.py openspec/changes/github-issue-<number>-<slug>`.
6. Search existing app code and tests.
7. Implement a narrow change that satisfies the spec delta.
8. Add or update focused tests.
9. Run the narrowest useful validation first.
10. Open a draft PR with OpenSpec change link, evidence, and human-review notes.

## OpenSpec-Style Change Artifacts

Use `references/open-spec-template.md` for the required folder shape, headings, and demo-friendly language. The artifacts are not ceremony; they are the contract that connects the request, implementation, QA, review, and incident follow-up.

The change folder must include:

- source issue/comment link
- proposal with why, what changes, impact, assumptions, and non-goals
- spec delta with acceptance criteria expressed as requirements and scenarios
- design notes for the smallest safe implementation
- task checklist
- human gates
- validation plan
- evidence checklist

If a request has unresolved product, security, data, or environment questions, post the partial OpenSpec-style change and label `openhands:needs-human` instead of guessing.

## Petstore Map

- Catalog behavior: `app/petstore_app/catalog.py`
- Adoption behavior: `app/petstore_app/adoptions.py`
- Static UI: `app/web/`
- Tests: `app/tests/`
- OpenSpec-style changes: `openspec/changes/github-issue-<number>-<slug>/`

## Sparse Story Examples

`Filter pets by max adoption fee` means:

- add an optional max-fee filter to catalog search, using integer cents
- expose a simple static UI input only if the issue or PR scope includes UI
- add focused backend tests for match, exclusion, and invalid negative fees
- do not add payment processing, persistence, billing, auth, or dependencies

`Let adopters search by age range` means:

- add optional min/max age filters
- reject negative ages and inverted ranges
- keep default search limited to available pets
- add focused backend tests

## Stop Conditions

Ask for human input if the issue requires a product decision, schema migration, auth change, new dependency, environment change, secret access, or production mutation.

## PR Requirements

The PR body must show:

- OpenSpec change path
- assumptions and non-goals
- acceptance criteria status
- files changed
- tests run
- residual risks
- reminder that humans approve review and merge decisions
